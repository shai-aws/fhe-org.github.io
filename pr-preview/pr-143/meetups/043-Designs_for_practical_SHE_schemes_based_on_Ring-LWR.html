<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p>The Learning with Errors problem (LWE) and its variants are among the most popular assumptions underlying lattice-based cryptography. The Learning with Rounding problem (LWR) can be thought of as a deterministic variant of LWE. While lattice-based cryptography is known to enable many advanced constructions, constructing Fully Homomorphic Encryption schemes based on LWR remains an under-explored part of the literature.</p>

<p>In this talk, I will introduce the LWR problem, and describe how to construct Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption schemes based on Ring-LWR that are the analogue of the Ring-LWE-based BFV scheme. We will discuss new LWR-based SHE schemes in the LPR and Regev paradigms. The Regev-type scheme can be seen as a generalisation of the only prior work in this direction (Costache-Smart, 2017). Both schemes present several improvements compared to this prior work, and in particular we resolve the “tangled modulus” issue in the Costache-Smart scheme that led to unmanageable noise growth. The talk will discuss the benefits of basing constructions on LWR, as well as the challenges this can bring.</p>

<p>This is joint work with M. Bolboceanu, A. Costache, R. Player, M. Rosca, R. Titiu.</p>
