<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p>Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a powerful tool to achieve non-interactive privacy preserving protocols with optimal computation/communication complexity. However, the main disadvantage is that the actual communication cost (bandwidth) is high due to the large size of FHE ciphertexts. As a solution, a technique called transciphering (also known as Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption) was introduced to achieve almost optimal bandwidth for such protocols. However, all of existing works require clients to fix a precision for the messages or a mathematical structure for the message space beforehand. It results in unwanted constraints on the plaintext size or underlying structure of FHE based applications.</p>

<p>This talk introduces a new approach for transciphering which does not require fixed message precision decided by the client, for the first time. In more detail, a client uses any kind of FHE-friendly symmetric cipher for {0,1} to send its input data encrypted bit-by-bit, then the server can choose a precision p depending on the application and homomorphically transforms the encrypted bits into FHE ciphertexts encrypting integers in Z_p. This talk shows an efficient evaluation of the new technique using FiLIP cipher and adapt the most practical homomorphic evaluation technique [CCS’22] to keep the practical latency. The practical running time as a proof-of-concept implementation will be also given at the end of this talk.</p>

<h1 id="about-the-speaker">About the speaker</h1>

<p>Jeongeun Park is a cryptographer, mainly studying FHE and its applications, currently working at COSIC, KU Leuven as a postdoctoral researcher.</p>

<p>She has developed existing FHE schemes to handle multiple users securely and efficiently, which allows FHE to be realized in more general application scenarios.</p>

<p>She also has designed efficient privacy preserving protocols such as PIR, machine learning algorithms as applications of FHE.</p>
